# Advent of Code 2020 in Rust

Advent of Code tasks written in Rust. I also tried to do some measurements of execution time.

## How to run

Rust and Cargo installed is must.

From directory with the Cargo.toml, run development version
```
cargo run
```
or build release version and run it
```
cargo build --release

./target/release/advent_of_code_2020
```
